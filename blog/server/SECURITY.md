# Blog Security Improvements

This document describes the security improvements made to the blog system.

## Server-Side Authentication

The system now uses server-side authentication instead of client-side verification:

1. User credentials are validated on the server
2. Session tokens are generated and stored server-side
3. Session expiration is enforced (30-minute timeout)
4. API endpoints for auth management: login, verify, logout

## Database Storage

User credentials are stored securely in the database:

1. Password hashes only (no plaintext passwords)
2. User table with secure UUID primary keys
3. Login timestamp tracking

## Protected Endpoints

All write operations now require authentication:

1. POST /api/posts - Create new posts
2. PUT /api/posts/:id - Update existing posts
3. DELETE /api/posts/:id - Delete posts

## Authorization Headers

API requests now use proper authorization:

1. Bearer token authentication
2. Authorization headers instead of URL parameters
3. CORS configured to work with credentials

## Security Best Practices

1. No sensitive credentials in client-side code
2. Authentication state managed with secure tokens
3. Session verification on critical operations
4. Password hashing for secure storage

## Future Improvements

1. Rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks
2. IP-based restrictions for admin access
3. Enhanced audit logging
4. CSRF token implementation
5. Consider moving to OAuth2 or similar for authentication

## Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in the server directory with:

```
ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH=your_secure_password_hash
SECRET_KEY=your_random_secret_key
```

Generate a secure hash with:

```python
import hashlib
hashlib.sha256("your_secure_password".encode()).hexdigest()
```
